👋 Hi, I'm Ashkan Amouzandeh, a recent computer science and engineering graduate.🎓

💻 Programming has always been a hobby of mine, way before I even started my bachelor's. As a result, I've worked on a lot of personal projects in the past years, of which a subset can be viewed here, in my repositories.

Currently, I'm learning React Native and Firebase by developing a productivity app. 📱 I'm planning to extend this app with a syncing chrome/edge extension in the future.

Please feel free to have a look at my projects and don't hesitate to reach out for any questions. 😄

📫 My email is ashkan.amou@gmail.com
